The Safe Sources App came to fruition through collaborative efforts during the MIT Futuremakers Create-a-thon in Summer 2023. Serving as an App Development Mentor for SureStart's Team 1b, Jillian played a pivotal role in guiding and mentoring a dynamic group of 10 middle school students across Teams 1a and 1b, resulting in the successful realization of this impactful project.

Developed using MIT App Inventor, the Safe Sources App addresses a critical need â€” equipping students with a reliable tool to assess the credibility of sources. Through the app, users gain access to a comprehensive database that aids in evaluating the reliability of websites and sources, providing indispensable guidance for effective information gathering.

Throughout the development process, Jillian assumed a leadership role in guiding the students through the entirety of the project lifecycle. This encompassed brainstorming sessions to refine initial ideas, streamlining concepts for clarity, establishing the project's branding, overseeing the development phase, and coordinating the creation of the accompanying slide deck. Her involvement extended to debugging concepts, providing clarity on intricate ideas, and ensuring the project met specific competition requirements.

The experience was a gratifying blend of mentorship, collaboration, and problem-solving, resulting in an empowered student cohort armed with a tool that enhances their critical thinking and information literacy skills.
